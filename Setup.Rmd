## Requirements

**This project is best used by setting it up as an RStudio Project**.

This project can be run on all major computer platforms. The necessary files are available in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stuzog/Intro2R.git). To download and use them, the following programs must be installed on your computer:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Once these are properly set up, you can proceed to installation:

## Quick Summary

Here are the stages of installing this project:

1. Install `r` and `git` on your computer
1. Decide where to put the _Project Directory_
1. `cd` into what will be its parent directory
1. Clone the project files from GitHub
1. Install and open RStudio on your computer
1. Create a new RStudio Project in the _Project Directory_
1. Install and initialise `packrat`
1. Set up an account on GitHub if you don't have one
1. Create a new repository in your GitHub account
1. Add it to RStudio as a _Github destination_
1. Push the files in your Project Directory to GitHub
1. Continue to [Part1](Part1_R_Data_Science.html) of your introduction to R

It may look intimidating, but it's fairly easy to work through.

## Installation Details

Carefully follow these instructions, in their order.

### Create The Project Directory

1. In your Terminal program, `cd` into the directory where you want to create the new project. This can be located wherever you want. It will be called `Intro2R`, so there should not be an existing directory with the same name in that location.

2. Enter the following commands at the command line, one at a time, followed by `RETURN`:

```
git clone https://github.com/stuzog/Intro2R.git
cd Intro2R
ls -al
```

You should see a listing of the GitHub repository files (with your user name):

### Make It An RStudio Project

3. **Launch RStudio on your computer**. Unless you have used RStudio before, you will see a fairly unpopulated RStudio window.

4. **Start a new RStudio project** by clicking on `R Projects` in the upper-right corner of the RStudio window, or via the _File > New Project..._ menu item. The _Create New Project_ window will appear:

![](images/RStudio_new_project_window.png)

5. **Select _Existing Directory_** and navigate to the newly-created `Intro2R` project directory. Click _Open in new session_ if you wish to preserve the current RStudio session.

![](images/RStudio_create_from_existing_directory_window.png)

6. **Click _Create Project_**. You will see the following `Error` and `Warning` messages, which you can ignore for now. They will be corrected later in the setup.

```
Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) : 
  cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) :
  cannot open file 'packrat/init.R': No such file or directory
```

### Install `packrat`

**Because R packages are updated frequently**, it is recommended that you use a [project package management](http://r.stuzog.com/RStudio.html#project-package-management) system. This project uses the [`packrat`](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package dependency management system for R, so this should now be installed.

7. **In the _Console window_** at the bottom left of the RStudio interface, enter the following commands followed by `RETURN`, one at a time:

```
install.packages("packrat")
packrat::init()
```

The Console will install `packrat` and the dependencies required for the project:

```
> install.packages("packrat")

8. **Click the _Packages tab_ in the _Files....Viewer pane_** (usually bottom right). It will now show a listing of packages installed in the project _Packrat Library_:

![](images/RStudio_packages.png)

From now, all new packages will be installed in this project-specific library.

9. **Click _Update_ in the _Packages tab toolbar_** to ensure that all project packages are current. Packages are updated frequently, so it is advisable to do this from time to time.

## GitHub Version Control

**It's a really good idea to track your R coding with some form of [version control](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)**.

RStudio makes this easy for you. 

[git](https://git-scm.com/) has become the leading version control system --- there's even comprehensive a [free eBook on git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) that you can download and study. There also are some [easy-to-understand explanations on how `git` works ](https://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/) available on the Web.

**`git` support is built-in to RStudio**. This makes keeping track of your many ch-ch-ch-changes an integral part of your R programming workflow.

### Setting Up `git` In RStudio

How you set up `git` in RStudio depends on whether you are:

* Starting a new Project:
  * [first from GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)
  * [from RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
  * [from a GitHub clone](http://happygitwithr.com/clone.html)
* Adding `git` to an existing Project
  * [starting from GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html), or
  * [starting from RStudio](http://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html)

Each alternative takes a slightly different path through the RStudio/GitHub maze. They are best detailed in [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 Teaching Assistants of UBC. [RStudio's version control guide](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) also shows how to use `git` or an [SVN repository](http://subversion.apache.org/) for version control.

### Using `git` In RStudio

**When `git` is properly set up a new _Git_ tab** will appear in the _Environment... Build_ pane. Clicking on this tab will show files and directories that have changed since the last synchronisation with the _GitHub repository_ associated with this Project. If you keep this tab open, you will see its contents change each time you Save a file, or rebuild an entire Web site.

![***Above:** The Git pane showing changes during work on this .Rmd file*](images/RStudio_Git_pane.png)

The _GitHub Push_ workflow is:

1. _Stage_ any modified file or directory
1. _Commit_ selected _Staged_ files or directories, adding a brief _Commit message_
1. _Push_ all _Committed_ files/directories to a _GitHub repository_.

**If you're new to `git` and somewhat intimidated by it**, [A Visual Introduction to Git](https://medium.com/@ashk3l/a-visual-introduction-to-git-9fdca5d3b43a) gives an amusing introduction to the basic `git` workflow.

**For a detailed overview from a developer perspective** see [Git and GitHub](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) by Hadley Wickham. It particulaly refers to R package development.

#### Staging Changed Items

1. **Click its _Staged_ checkbox**. A small blue box labelled `M` appears in the left _Status_ column, showing that the file or directory was _Modified_ and ready for a _Commit_. If you had only added the file, a small green box labelled `A` will appear.

1. **If you click on a listed directory**, its contents will all appear, marked _Staged_ and with small green boxes signifying that they have been _Added._

![_**Above:** Staging a directory will result in its contents all being shown Staged._](images/RStudio_staged_directories.png)

3. **To _Unstage_ added sub-directories or files** you either deselect each individually then deselect the _Staged_ parent directory, or `SHIFT Click` all of them and uncheck  one _Selected_ radio button.

#### Committing Staged Items

When you have _Staged_ everything you want, the next step is to _Commit_ those _Staged_ items.

4.**Click the _Committ_ button to do this**. The _Review Changes_ window appears. You can add a message to remind you (and others) what you have done in this _Commit_. This is always advisable, especially for others reviewing your repository.

![_**Above:** The RStudio Review Changes window with a Commit message._](images/RStudio-review-changes.png)

A smaller _Progress window_ will open over the _Review window_. It is actually a small _Terminal window_ showing what you would see if you were at the command line.

![_**Above:** The Progress window shows the result of your Commit command._](images/RStudio-git-commit-progress.png)

#### Pushing To GitHub

5. Your files are now Committed; the next step is to **Push** them to the Repository. The `green up-arrow` is the **Push button**. You may have to close the _Progress window_ first.

![_**Above:** The Push only happens when you click the green Push button._](images/RStudio-push-progress.png)

6. If everything went well, you will see this message in the _Progress window_ (it wil open automatically if you had closed it).

![_**Above:** After a successful Push, everything is up-to-date._](images/RStudio-push-changes.png)
