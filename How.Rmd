## Requirements

**This project is best used by setting it up as an RStudio Project**.

The necessary files are available in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stuzog/Intro2R.git). To download and use it, the following programs must be installed on your computer:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Once these are available, you can proceed to the next step:

## Create The Project Directory

1. In your Terminal program, `cd` into the directory where you want to create the new project. This can be located wherever you want. It will be called `Intro2R`, so there should not be an existing directory with the same name in that location.

2. Enter the following commands at the command line, one at a time, followed by `RETURN`:

```
git clone https://github.com/stuzog/Intro2R.git
cd Intro2R
ls -al
```

You should see a listing of the GitHub repository files (with your user name):

## Make It An RStudio Project

1. **Launch RStudio on your computer**. Unless you have used RStudio before, you will see a fairly unpopulated RStudio window.

2. **Start a new RStudio project** by clicking on `R Projects` in the upper-right corner of the RStudio window, or via the _File > New Project..._ menu item. The _Create New Project_ window will appear:

3. **Select _Existing Directory_** and navigate to the newly-created `Intro2R` project directory. Click _Open in new session_ if you wish to preserve the current RStudio session.

4. **Click _Create Project_**. You will see the following errors, which you can ignore for now. They will be corrected later in the setup.

```
Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) : 
  cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) :
  cannot open file 'packrat/init.R': No such file or directory
```
