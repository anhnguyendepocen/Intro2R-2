## RMarkdown

**[RMarkdown documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) are the default RStudio document type**.

They are plain-text files with the `.Rmd` extension that can be used to generate many different types of output. The main ones are:

* [HTML documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html) -- `.html`
* [PDF Documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html) -- `.pdf`
* [Word Documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/word_document_format.html) -- `.docx`

(_the links go to their RStudio documentation_)

#### Other Output Formats

In addition to the standard output formats (above), RMarkdown documents can generate output in many other formats, via the [pandoc](#pandoc) conversion engine.

[Beamer](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/beamer_presentation_format.html), [HTML5 slides](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html), [Tufte-style handouts](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html), [books](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), [dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), [interactive documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html), [scientific articles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles), and [websites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).

[**RStudio maintains a gallery of examples**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html) of the many uses of RMarkdown.

### Language Engines

**RMarkdown uses the [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) report generation package** to output to the different file formats. This enables integration of R code into [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), [LyX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LyX), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [AsciiDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc), and [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) documents.

**The knitr package can execute chunks in a variety of languages**. It does this with [knitr Language Engines](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_knitr_engines.html), which include engines for:

* Python
* SQL
* Bash
* Rcpp
* Stan
* JavaScript
* CSS

**To process a code chunk using an alternate language engine** simply use the name of the engine in place of `{r}` in the chunk declaration, for example:

```
## {bash}
## cat flights1.csv flights2.csv flights3.csv > flights.csv
```

### pandoc

The RStudio installation includes [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which is used for conversion between RMarkdown and [the various output formats](#other-output-formats). You may have to [install pandoc on your system](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) for conversion to take place, especially for `.pdf` output, which goes through an intermediate `LaTeX` stage.

`pandoc` can also be run from the commond line if it is installed separately. This is explained in detail in the [pandoc manual](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).

## R Notebooks

**[R Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) are the most basic type of [RMarkdown](#rmarkdown) document**. They are the RStudio equivalent to [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

As described by [RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html):

> An R Notebook is an R Markdown document with chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input.

Any R Markdown document can be used as a notebook, and all R Notebooks can be rendered to other R Markdown document types.

### Creating An R Notebook File

**The RStudio menu item `File -> New File -> R Notebook`** creates a new [RStudio Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) containing some initial instructions on using an R Notebook.

````
---
title: "R Notebook"
output:
  html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```
{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

````

This can be overwritten to create new content.

For more information see [RStudio Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).

### R Notebook HTML files

**An [R Notebook HTML file](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebook_format.html) is a special type of [R Notebook](#r-notebook)**.

It is an HTML file that uses the `.nb.html` extension and it enables:

* **the source .Rmd document** and
* **chunk outputs** to be recovered.

The `html_notebook` output format is specified in the YAML metadata:

```
title: "my_document_title"
output:
    html_notebook
```

With the `_yaml` file written this way, the command `rmarkdown::render()` will create an `.nb.html` R Notebook HTML Format file.

For more information, see [Details of the R Notebook HTML Format](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebook_format.html).

**Note**: The [RStudio instructions](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebook_format.html#generating-r-notebooks-with-custom-output) show an incorrect `YAML` header. You must use the `_yaml` format shown above or RStudio will throw an error and not compile.
