## R Notebooks

**[R Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) are the most basic type of [RMarkdown](#rmarkdown) document**. They are the RStudio equivalent to [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

As described by [RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html):

> An R Notebook is an R Markdown document with chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input.

Any R Markdown document can be used as a notebook, and all R Notebooks can be rendered to other R Markdown document types.

### Creating An R Notebook File

**The RStudio menu item `File -> New File -> R Notebook`** creates a new [RStudio Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) containing some initial instructions on using an R Notebook.

````
---
title: "R Notebook"
output:
  html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```
{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

````

This can be overwritten to create new content.

For more information see [RStudio Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).

### R Notebook HTML files

**An [R Notebook HTML file](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebook_format.html) is a special type of [R Notebook](#r-notebook)**.

It is an HTML file that uses the `.nb.html` extension and it enables:

* **the source .Rmd document** and
* **chunk outputs** to be recovered.

The `html_notebook` output format is specified in the YAML metadata:

```
title: "my_document_title"
output:
    html_notebook
```

With the `_yaml` file written this way, the command `rmarkdown::render()` will create an `.nb.html` R Notebook HTML Format file.

For more information, see [Details of the R Notebook HTML Format](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebook_format.html).

**Note**: The [RStudio instructions](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebook_format.html#generating-r-notebooks-with-custom-output) show an incorrect `YAML` header. You must use the `_yaml` format shown above or RStudio will throw an error and not compile.

## RMarkdown

> R Markdown documents are fully reproducible. They use a productive notebook interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly-formatted output from multiple languages including R, Python, and SQL.<br />--- [_RStudio RMarkdown_](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

**[RMarkdown documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) are the default RStudio document**. They are plain-text files with the `.Rmd` extension and can be used to generate many different types of output. The main ones are:

* [HTML documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html) -- `.html`
* [PDF Documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html) -- `.pdf`
* [Word Documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/word_document_format.html) -- `.docx`

In addition to the standard output formats (above), RMarkdown documents can generate output in many other formats, via the [pandoc](#pandoc) conversion engine.

[Beamer](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/beamer_presentation_format.html), [HTML5 slides](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html), [Tufte-style handouts](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html), [books](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), [dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), [interactive documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html), [scientific articles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles), and [websites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).

[**RStudio maintains a gallery of examples**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html) of the many uses of RMarkdown.

### knitr

<image src="images/knitr.png" class="small-left-1em" />

> RMarkdown uses the [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) report generation package to output to the different file formats.

**The `knitr` package enables integration of R code into [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), [LyX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LyX), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [AsciiDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc), and [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) documents**. It can execute code chunks in a variety of languages via [knitr Language Engines](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_knitr_engines.html), including for:

* R
* Python
* SQL
* Bash
* Rcpp
* Stan
* JavaScript
* CSS

**To process a code chunk using an alternate language engine** simply use the name of the engine in place of `{r}` in the chunk declaration, for example:

````
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cat flights1.csv flights2.csv flights3.csv > flights.csv
```
````

#### Code Chunk Options

**RMarkdown code chunk processing can be controlled** by including [_Chunk Options_](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html) in the _Chunk Declaration_, for example:

`{r, include = FALSE`} prevents code and results from appearing.  
R Markdown still runs the code and the results can be used by other chunks.  
`{r, eval = FALSE`} prevents to code from running but it still appears.
`{r, echo = FALSE`} prevents code but not the results from appearing.  
This is a useful way to embed figures.  
`{r, message = FALSE`} prevents messages generated by code from appearing.  
`{r, warning = FALSE`} prevents warnings generated by code from appearing.  
`{r, fig.cap = "..."`} adds a caption to graphical results.

The [R Markdown Reference Guide (.pdf)](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) has a list of useful options. [Yihui's `knitr` options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) has full documentation of all `knitr` code processing controls.

### pandoc

The RStudio installation includes [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which is used for conversion between RMarkdown and [the various output formats](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html). You may have to [install pandoc on your system](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) for conversion to take place, especially for `.pdf` output, which goes through an intermediate `LaTeX` stage.

`pandoc` can also be run from the commond line if it is installed separately. This is explained in detail in the [pandoc manual](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).

## Shiny

> [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents or build [dashboards](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/). You can also extend your Shiny apps with [CSS themes](http://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/), [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), and JavaScript [actions](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/blob/master/README.md).<br /> --- [_RStudio Shiny_](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)

**[RStudio's Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a Web application framework for R that takes static [RMarkdown documents](#rmarkdown) and [Web sites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html) to the next level**.

There is no limit to building online documentation, interactive tutorials, and statistical data interfaces with these powerful R packages:

* [`htmlwidgets`](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) enables JavaScript visualisations and interactive components to be incorporated into [R Markdown documents](#rmarkdown) and Shiny web applications, as shown in this [showcase](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html) and this [gallery](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/)

* [`crosstalk`](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) wires widgets together, including linked brushing between widgets and client side filtering

* [`shinydashboard`](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) makes it easy to create all kinds of Web dashboards, as shown in [these examples](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/examples.html)

and others:

* [`intrval`](https://github.com/psolymos/intrval) can be used to build for example, a [Web slider](http://peter.solymos.org/code/2018/03/08/shiny-slider-examples-with-the-intrval-r-package.html)

We will explore [building Shiny apps](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) in a future Tutorial.

### Shiny Server

[Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) makes your [Shiny Web apps](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) accessible on a local network, an Enterprise server, or on the Internet. There are two flavours of server:

* [Shiny Server Open Source](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/) and 
* [Shiny Server Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/)

Documentation is available for:

* [Installing Shiny Server Open Source](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/)
* [Shiny Server Pro Admin Guide](http://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/)
* [shinyapps.io User Guide](http://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/index.html)

Shiny Apps can be available to an Intranet or to the Internet via:

* [An Enterprise Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/)
* [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)
* [shinyapps.io](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/)

The difference between the latter two is [explained here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/217240558-What-is-the-difference-between-shinyapps-io-and-Shiny-Server-Pro-).

## bookdown

<img src="images/bookdown_logo.png" class="small-left" />

> [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) is an open-source R package that makes it really easy to creates online books and technical documents using [RMarkdown](#rmarkdown).

**`bookdown` books open a new avenue for Web-enabled book publishing**.

They are essentially **responsive RMarkdown Web sites**, complete with content navigation, plus the ability to display and process computer code using a wide range of programming languages, including interactive [Shiny dashboards](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/examples.html) and [Web apps](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).

**`bookdown` has added a few important missing features** related to writing books, such as figure and table caption numbering and cross-references, and the ability to embed [HTML widgets](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shinyapps/) or [Shiny apps](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).

**Developed and maintained by RStudio software engineer [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name)**, `bookdown` books can be published on [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/), a free service provided by [RStudio Inc](https://www.rstudio.com/about/). Books are available for download, and the author holds full copyright.

[<img src="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/images/cover.jpg" class="small-left" />](https://bookdown.org/)

**Fully-documented** in --- of course! --- a [`bookdown` book called _bookdown_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), the `bookdown` package uses many of the same conventions as [other RMarkdown document types](#rmarkdown), so conversion of any RStudio project to an online book is relatively straightforward.

[A Minimal Book Example](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo) can be cloned from GitHub. It can also be downloaded as a [`.zip` file](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo/archive/master.zip) if you are [not familiar with GitHub](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

### `bookdown` Installation

[Installation](https://bookdown.org/home/getting-started.html) requires the [devtools](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) R package to be first installed, after which `bookdown` can be installed from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown):

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

### `tinytex`

**PDF output requires some version of the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) typesetting system** to be installed. LaTeX is not a stand-alone typesetting program in itself, but document preparation software that runs on top of Donald E. Knuth's [TeX typesetting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX).

**[TeX distributions](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) usually bundle together all the parts needed** for a working TeX system. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and many of the packages built on it form an important component of any modern TeX distribution.

**As this is a large package consisting of many gigabytes of files** that users may not wish to install, [Yihui Xie wrote `tinytex`](https://yihui.name/tinytex/), a lightweight, cross-platform, portable, and easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution based on [TeX Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live).

#### `tinytex` Installation

Installation of `tinytex` is accomplished with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c('tinytex', 'rmarkdown'))
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span> **[PDF output](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html) (including [Beamer slides](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/beamer_presentation_format.html)) requires a full TeX installation.**
